The output from the given Array should be as follows:

31 is a lucky number
33 is a lucky number
49 is a lucky number

A few keys/restrictions to the challenge are:
1. No temporary variables. This should be done using closures.
2. Use the sorted(), filter() and map() functions.
3. Use isMultiple(of:) function to remove the even numbers.
