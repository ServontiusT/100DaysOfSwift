# Challenge 4

Functions. This Challenge tasks us with finding the Square Root of an input number between 1 and 10,000. The catch is the built-in sqrt() function cannot be used. Other keys to this challenge are:

1. If the number is less than 1 or greater than 10,000, there should be an error that states the number is out of bounds.
2. We only have to solve for integer Square Roots. The example given is not to worry about the Square Root of 3 being 1.732
3. If the Square Root cannot be found, a "No Root" error should be provided.
